# Men Buy, Women Shop Analysis

The holidays have arrived and for many people that means long checkout lines, crowded parking lots and searching for the perfect gift. Me personally, I enjoy many things in life, but shopping is not on that list. The “Men Buy, Women Shop” (Initiative, 2007) attitude is deeply ingrained in my soul. Here is my shopping process, number one have a specific item to buy, second know exactly where the item is in the store and finally check out quickly as possible. My wife enjoys browsing, mingling looking around at different brands, colors, textures, all of which I have no interest in. Men prefer to buy a workable product rather than to keep looking, whereas women prefer to keep looking for a better product.  (Lewis, 2017). This Observation led me to form my conclusion that women account for a larger portion of a retail stores total sales. My Hypothesis is, if women enjoy shopping then does that translate into a higher total sale compared to men. I decided to focus on the retail industry for my final project. The data set I will be using comes from a company that provides data focusing on the different aspects of their business.
